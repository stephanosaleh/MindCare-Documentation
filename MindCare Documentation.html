          <p>Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.
            <br>
            Spending too much time planning, problem-solving, daydreaming, or thinking negative or random thoughts can be draining. It can also make you more likely to experience stress, anxiety and symptoms of depression. Practicing mindfulness exercises can help you direct your attention away from this kind of thinking and engage with the world around you.

          <p>There are many simple ways to practice mindfulness. Some examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Pay attention:</b> It's hard to slow down and notice things in a busy world. Try to take the time to experience your environment with all of your senses — touch, sound, sight, smell and taste. For example, when you eat a favorite food, take the time to smell, taste and truly enjoy it.</li>
          <code>"It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see."
— Henry David Thoreau</code>
          <li><b>Live in the moment:</b> Try to intentionally bring an open, accepting and discerning attention to everything you do. Find joy in simple pleasures.</li>
          <code>"The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it."
— Thich Nhat Hanh</code>
          <li><b>Accept yourself:</b> Treat yourself the way you would treat a good friend.</li>
          <code>"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."
— Ralph Waldo Emerson</code>
          <li><b>Focus on your breathing:</b> When you have negative thoughts, try to sit down, take a deep breath and close your eyes. Focus on your breath as it moves in and out of your body. Sitting and breathing for even just a minute can help.</li>
          <code>"Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. Conscious breathing is my anchor."
— Thich Nhat Hanh</code></ul>

          <p><ol><li>Keep a stress journal</li>
            <br>A stress journal can help you identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed, make a note of it in your journal or use a stress tracker on your phone. As you keep a daily log, you will begin to see patterns and common themes. Write down:
<ul>
<li>What caused your stress (make a guess if you’re unsure).</li>
<li>How you felt, both physically and emotionally.</li>
<li>How you acted in response.</li>
<li>What you did to make yourself feel better.</li></ul>
          </p>
          <p><li>Replace unhealthy coping strategies with healthy ones</li>
          <br>Think about the ways you currently manage and cope with stress in your life. Your stress journal can help you identify them. Are your coping strategies healthy or unhealthy? Many of us cope with stress in ways that make us feel better temporarily—but compound the problem in the long run.
          <ul>Unhealthy ways of dealing with stress
            <li>Using alcohol or drugs to relax.
<li>Bingeing on junk or comfort food.</li>
<li>Zoning out for hours on your phone or TV.</li>
<li>Withdrawing from friends, family, and social activities.</li>
<li>Sleeping too much.</li>
<li>Filling up every minute of the day to avoid facing problems.</li>
<li>Taking out your stress on others</li>
<li>Procrastinating.</li>
            </ul>
             
             <p><li>Practice the 4 As of stress management</li></p>
             There are many healthy ways to reduce stress or cope with its effects, but they all require change. You can either change the situation or change your reaction. When deciding which option to choose, it’s helpful to think of the four As: avoid, alter, accept, or adapt.

             <p>- Avoid unnecessary stress</p>
Not all stress can be avoided, and it’s not healthy to avoid a situation that needs to be addressed. But you may be surprised by the number of stressors in your life that you can eliminate.
<ul>
<li><b>Learn how to say “no.”</b> Know your limits and stick to them. Whether in your personal or professional life, taking on more than you can handle is a surefire recipe for stress.
</li>
<li><b>Avoid people who stress you out:</b> If someone consistently causes stress in your life, limit the amount of time you spend with that person, or end the relationship.
</li>
<li><b>Take control of your environment:</b> If the evening news makes you anxious, turn off the TV. If traffic makes you tense, take a longer but less-traveled route. If going to the market is an unpleasant chore, do your grocery shopping online.</li>

<li><b>Avoid hot-button topics:</b> If you get upset over religion or politics, cross them off your conversation list. If you repeatedly argue about the same subject with the same people, stop bringing it up or excuse yourself when it’s the topic of discussion.</li>

<li><b>Pare down your to-do list:</b> Analyze your schedule, responsibilities, and daily tasks. If you’ve got too much on your plate, distinguish between the “shoulds” and the “musts.” Drop tasks that aren’t truly necessary to the bottom of the list or eliminate them entirely.</li></ul>
<p>- Alter the situation</p>
If you can’t avoid a stressful situation, try to alter it. Often, this involves changing the way you communicate and operate in your daily life.
<ul>
  <li><b>Express your feelings instead of bottling them up:</b> If something or someone is bothering you, communicate your concerns in an open and respectful way. If you don’t voice your feelings, resentment will build and the stress will increase.</li>

<li><b>Be willing to compromise:</b> When you ask someone to change their behavior, be willing to do the same. If you both are willing to bend at least a little, you’ll have a good chance of finding a happy middle ground.
</li>
<li><b>Be more assertive:</b> Don’t take a backseat in your own life. Deal with problems head on, doing your best to anticipate and prevent them. If you’ve got an exam to study for and your chatty roommate just got home, say up front that you only have five minutes to talk.</li>

<li><b>Find balance:</b> All work and no play is a recipe for burnout. Try to find a balance between work and family life, social activities and solitary pursuits, daily responsibilities and downtime.
</li></ul>

<p>- Accept the things you can’t change</p>
Some sources of stress are unavoidable. You can’t prevent or change stressors such as the death of a loved one, a serious illness, or a national recession. In such cases, the best way to cope with stress is to accept things as they are. Acceptance may be difficult, but in the long run, it’s easier than railing against a situation you can’t change.
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t try to control the uncontrollable:</b> Many things in life are beyond our control, particularly the behavior of other people. Rather than stressing out over them, focus on the things you can control such as the way you choose to react to problems.</li>

<li><b>Look for the upside:</b> When facing major challenges, try to look at them as opportunities for personal growth. If your own poor choices contributed to a stressful situation, reflect on them and learn from your mistakes.
</li>
<li><b>Learn to forgive:</b> Accept the fact that we live in an imperfect world and that people make mistakes. Let go of anger and resentments. Free yourself from negative energy by forgiving and moving on.
</li>
<li><b>Share your feelings:</b> Expressing what you’re going through can be very cathartic, even if there’s nothing you can do to alter the stressful situation. Talk to a trusted friend or make an appointment with a therapist.
            </li> <p>- Adapt to the stressor</p>
             

If you can’t change the stressor, change yourself. You can adapt to stressful situations and regain your sense of control by changing your expectations and attitude.

<ul><li><b>Reframe problems:</b> Try to view stressful situations from a more positive perspective. Rather than fuming about a traffic jam, look at it as an opportunity to pause and regroup, listen to your favorite radio station, or enjoy some alone time.</li>

<li><b>Look at the big picture:</b> Take perspective of the stressful situation. Ask yourself how important it will be in the long run. Will it matter in a month? A year? Is it really worth getting upset over? If the answer is no, focus your time and energy elsewhere.</li>

<li><b>Adjust your standards:</b> Perfectionism is a major source of avoidable stress. Stop setting yourself up for failure by demanding perfection. Set reasonable standards for yourself and others, and learn to be okay with “good enough.”</li>

<li><b>Practice gratitude:</b> When stress is getting you down, take a moment to reflect on all the things you appreciate in your life, including your own positive qualities and gifts. This simple strategy can help you keep things in perspective.</li>

          <header>Mindfulness in Daily Life
          </header>
          <p>How often have you rushed out the door and into your day without even thinking about how you’d like things to go? Before you know it, something or someone has rubbed you the wrong way, and you’ve reacted automatically with frustration, impatience, or rage—in other words, you’ve found yourself acting in a way you never intended.

You don’t have to be stuck in these patterns. Pausing to practice mindfulness for just a few minutes at different times during the day can help your days be better, more in line with how you’d like them to be.

Explore these five daily practices for bringing more mindfulness into your life:</p>
           <ol>
             <li><b>Mindful Wakeup: Start with a Purpose</b><br>

Intention aligns conscious thinking with primal emotional drives, aiding mindful and compassionate responses during the day. Set your intention in the morning and revisit it throughout the day.</li>
<li><b>Mindful Eating: Enjoy Every Mouthful</b><br>

Mindful eating enriches the experience by bringing full attention to hunger and the eating process. Breathe before eating, listen to your body, eat according to hunger, practice peaceful eating, and enjoy what you eat.</li>
<li><b>Mindful Pause: Rewire Your Brain</b><br>

Mindfulness activates the slow brain, enabling intentional actions and willpower. Create new patterns by refreshing triggers and creating reminders to shift into mindfulness.</li>
<li><b>Mindful Workout: Activate Your Mind and Your Muscles</b><br>

Synchronize body, mind, and nervous system during physical activity. Set clear aims, warm up, settle into a rhythm, challenge yourself, cool down, and rest to enhance mindfulness and physical well-being.</li>
<li><b>Mindful Driving: Drive Yourself Calm, Not Crazy</b><br>

Use driving as an opportunity to practice mindfulness. Take deep breaths, understand and fulfill your needs, recognize other drivers' similar needs, and apply self-compassion to reduce stress and frustration.</li>

          <header>Creating a Mindful Routine
          </header>
          <p>How we spend our morning can greatly impact how the rest of our day will go. That’s why it’s important to start off our mornings on the right foot. We can do this by creating a mindful morning routine. Instead of waking up and immediately reaching for our devices, it helps to slow down and ease into the day peacefully.

There are many ways that you can reclaim the first part of your day. Here are just a few of our suggestions for morning mindfulness:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Journaling</b><br>
  Journaling is a great way for us to check in with how we’re feeling at the start of the day. You might use your morning journaling to reflect on your current emotions, write out your intentions or goals for the day, or list three things you’re grateful for. This practice can have a huge impact on our mood, motivation and mindset for the rest of the day.</li>
  <li><b>Meditate</b>
  Meditation may seem intimidating at first, but it is a wonderful way to slow down, focus on our breathing and find peace in the present moment. Even starting off with short 5-10 minute meditations in the morning can give you a good reset and sense of calm before entering the busy part of your day.
  </li>
  <li><b>Exercise</b>
  We can practice mindfulness through movement too. Find a type of exercise that you enjoy, whether that’s running, yoga, cycling, walking, or any other type of movement. Try to fit exercise in during the morning hours, before you fully start your day. This may require waking up quite a bit earlier, but it can have great physical and mental benefits.
  </li>
  <li><b>Read or Listen to Something You Enjoy</b>
  While you may not have a ton of time in the morning to do activities you love, even just 20 minutes of uninterrupted reading, listening to audiobook or podcast, or putting on your favorite music could get you in a good mood. All of these activities are mindful because they require us to be present to fully absorb them. So sit back, sip your morning coffee or tea, and indulge in an activity you enjoy for a short bit.
  </li>
  <li><b>Start Stretching</b>
  Stretching is another great activity to add to our mindful morning routine. It will help wake up your muscles and get you in tune with how your body is feeling. Try out this Mindful movement exercise to wake up your body and incorporate stretching into your daily routine.
  </li>
  <li><b>Prepare a Healthy Breakfast</b>
  Make yourself a delicious, healthy breakfast that you enjoy. Practice mindful eating in the morning by savoring each bite and noticing the different flavors. Even the practice of preparing our first meal of the day can become a mindful activity that’s enjoyable.</li>
  <li><b>Make Mundane Tasks More Mindful</b>
  We all have standard morning tasks that we run through, like brushing our teeth, making the bed, showering, and getting ready. Even these more mundane activities can become mindful too. As you go about these morning tasks, challenge yourself to stay in the present moment and observe your thoughts and feelings about the upcoming day.

Giving ourselves more time in the morning to be fully present before jumping into work, school or our screens can be incredibly beneficial for our mental health. Find a morning mindfulness routine that works for you, and see how it impacts the rest of your days.
